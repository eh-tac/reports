# Comps

`Admiral Plif` was kind enough to organise two competitions around my first battle release!

You should fly [XvT-TC 146: Securing the Line](https://tc.emperorshammer.org/download.php?id=1461&type=info) for a `high score` and then file a `review`. If you do that, you'll have entered the two comps. How easy was that?

# Projects

No one took up my vague call to action for `Project Archimedes` last time, which I guess shows how carried away I was by delusions of grandeur. Perhaps no one reads these.

Here's how it works for the technically inclined - I've `sliced` some code that performs static analysis on TIE series missions. In this way I `leverage` my skills and knowledge into a tool that can help us track down bugs and improve the compendium at colossal scale.

For the non-technically inclined... it's `magic space pixies`.

Not all issues are serious, and not everything that `Archimedes` finds will definitely be an issue. For example:

- IFF mismatch with mothership: Rebel X-Wings launching from an Imperial mothership will _usually_ be a bug. A traitorous Imperial shuttle leaving a Rebel cruiser is not.
- Any ship with orders to `destroy all Rebel IFF` can cause issues if something needs to be captured. (Be careful with IFF orders, they lack subtlety)
- Most of the time a message that is triggered by _100%_ arrival of a flight group with _multiple_ waves is a mistake - if you've ever been told 'Look out for those X-Wings' having already killed the first wave, you've seen this. But sometimes it might be deliberate.

(Were you confused by any of this lingo? Go take some mission creation IWATS !)

.

Also: we're making some headway on the `Battle Submission Queue` thanks to the TAC Staff and that `XWA patch installer` is not forgotten - just waiting on a dude for a thing.

# TAC-tivity

More code! Lots of code! I added something pretty cool to the TAC site this week, but you'll only see it if you help us out with some testing. The positions are open to anyone who's never died streaming TIE on Twitch.

I was awarded two `Letters of Achievement` for submissions to [COMMODORE V: Plif Strikes Back](http://tc.emperorshammer.org/commodore/volume5/)

I aged over the weekend like a dusty bottle of Aurora Red.
