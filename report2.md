I haven't yet found my reporting rhythm yet...

# Release News

Tonight's special at the `TAC Cafe` is a two course meal:

As an entree, we have a bug fix for `Genadmeral Schueler's` Starfighter Histories: TIE Advanced [(TIE-F 283)](https://tc.emperorshammer.org/download.php?id=1407&type=info). There's still over 500 bugs to fix, but this is the first one knocked off!

And the main course: back in 2015, `Major Spiffy` submitted an outline for `Plif`'s Battle Storylines competition and `Dempsey` turned it into a battle!

[XvT-TC 146: Securing the Line](https://tc.emperorshammer.org/download.php?id=1461&type=info) is now available for your flying pleasure!

# Projects

I've done a little testing of the `XWA patch installer` and it's looking good. It's very close to getting the green light.

`Project Archimedes` took some massive steps towards being useful, and the first two entries were prototyped with great success. My next report will have a specific example to share , but for now why not email me guessing what the project is?

We're making some headway on the `Battle Submission Queue` thanks to the TAC Staff. Would you like to get involved in testing? Shoot me an email!

# TAC-tivity

Code code code. I've actually been pretty busy with TAC things for this past fortnight, but at the moment very little of it is visible. Rest assured that things are going on behind the scenes - it's like the foundations of the building are being laid. For a good long while all you can see is a massive hole in the ground, and then suddenly `*poof*` you've got something useful.

I graded a test... Congrats to `Aldaric` for being my first `TM/3` graduate - I hope to see a submission from you soon!

# TAC Stats

The most prolific reviewer in the Battle Center has submitted `223` reviews.

XWA-TC 48 (Pirates of the Corellian) is an inexplicably popular choice for high score comps. `GN Gilad Pelleaon` has the 10th best score of all time.
