Well done, sir!</p><p>I'd like to highlight the <a style='color: #BFD58E;' href='https://tc.emperorshammer.org/download.php?id=1461&type=reviews'>reviews</a> in particular. They were very hard to decide between.</p><p><span style='color: #FEC701;'>Rando</span>'s review was a nice mission by mission recap with some useful notes on what to look out for.</p><p><span style='color: #FEC701;'>Plif</span>'s review considered the story aspects in greater detail, with some musings on the relationship between plot and execution.</p><p>Both were fine examples of the review form. I encourage everyone to read through them and think about leaving a few reviews themselves. (A short review can be great too, you don't have to go into the same level of detail!)</p></td>

He's craftily decoded the format of the XWA patches and made a replacement for the 16 bit executable that no longer ran on modern systems.</p><p>Not only that, he's worked tirelessly to ensure that we don't lose this knowledge in the future by documenting his findings and sharing the source code.</p><p>A huge problem for the <span style='color: #FEC701;'>Emperor's Hammer</span> over basically it's entire life has been the loss of resources and knowledge to technical failures, schisms and personnel attrition. How many times did we lose the database/forums/email/domain/etc? Where could we be if we'd been able to add to existing foundations instead of reconstructing them from scratch?</p><p>To counter this, I'm very keen to create backups of everything and ensure things are not so easily lost. To this end I've set up an <a style='color: #BFD58E;' href='https://github.com/eh-tac'>EH TAC</a> organisation on Github. The updated <span style='color: #FEC701;'>tiepatch</span> is the first bit of saved code, with a few other projects to follow.</p><p>The updated XWA patches will be released this weekend.</p></td>
