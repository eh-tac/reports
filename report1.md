# Introduction

After a period of wandering the corridors and trying not to look too lost, I've found my new office aboard the VSD Sinister.

Way back in 2002, the Battle Center was what attracted me to the TIE Corps. I'm thrilled and honoured to be named as the latest custodian of the compendium.

I've got a lot of ideas to bring to the Tactical Office, starting with some improved communication. After that, I'll be aiming to leverage my programming skills in a variety of TAC-related projects.

# News

I was appointed as the new Tactical Officer! The other applicants have been kind enough to volunteer as Tactical Staff - thank you `Dempsey` and `Mark Schueler`. (Slogan: You don't have to be a `General` to work here, but it helps!)

# Projects

`Colonel Impulse` has done some outstanding work on an `XWA patch installer` that will work on modern Windows environments! We're in the process of testing it before a rollout. I had nothing to do with it and I applaud his initiative.

The `Battle Submission Queue` is going to get some movement. This may depend on a bit of work to iron out some kinks in the `Tactical Office Database` which I have to investigate.

`Project Archimedes` - the first major initiative of my tenure. All you get for now is the name...

# TAC-tivity

Mainly my first week has involved getting access to a bunch of different TAC things - TC site, EH site, IWATS, tac.eh.org, tac@ email, etc. I think we're nearly there.

My predecessor `Xavier Sienar` has been kind enough to catch me up on his projects, and `Dempsey` has been very helpful with providing access.

I'm on email and Telegram - definitely hit me up if you've got any TAC related ideas.

I approved some `High Scores` (from `Rando` who else?) and denied some BSFs submitted for the wrong battles.

This report was actually written in some `Markdown` and then parsed into some neato HTML copied largely from `AD Plif`, who has the shinest in the business. Once I refine the script I'll see if anyone else wants to use it.

# What's Next?

I'll be trying to release fortnightly reports as long as there's something meaningful to say. (If there's not, I'll release some staff from an airlock instead.)

For the next report, I plan to have:

The `XWA patch installer` documented, tested and released for general use.

My first bug fix.

My first new mission release.

My first graded test. (`Aldaric`, I'll be getting to your test as soon as I find the right button)

Details of `Project Archimedes`.
